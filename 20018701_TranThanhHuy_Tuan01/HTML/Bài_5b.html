       The text is more properly called "Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis, or, 
       The little Key of Solomon". The title most commonly used, "The Lesser Key of Solomon,"
       does not in fact occur in the manuscripts. A.E. Waite, in his 1898 Book of Black Magic
       and of Pacts does use the terms "so-called Greater Key" and "Lesser Key" to distinguish 
       between the Clavicula Salomonis and Lemegeton, so he may have been the first one to coin it.

   <h2><div id="b">Source Anchors</div></h2>
   <p>
       The most obvious source for the Ars Goetia is Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum 
       in his De praestigiis daemonum. Weyer does not cite, and is unaware of, any other books 
       in the Lemegeton, suggesting that the Lemegeton was derived from his work, not the other 
       way around.[2][9] The order of the spirits changed between the two, four additional spirits 
       were added to the later work, and one spirit (Pruflas) was omitted.

   <h2><div id="c">Detinations Anchors </div></h2>
   <p>
      An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to secure a vessel 
      to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current.
      The word derives from Latin ancora, which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυρα (ankȳra).

   <p>
      Elliot John Gleave (born 20 June 1982), better known by his stage name Example, 
      is an English musician, singer, songwriter, rapper and record producer.
      His name arose due to his initials being E.G., which is an abbreviation 
      of the Latin phrase exempli gratia ("for example")
